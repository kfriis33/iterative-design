    <h1>Iterative Design: Carbon Chain</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Carbon Chain Context</h2>
      <p>Our startup was Carbon Chain, which provides software for companies to more accurately and 
        efficiently track their carbon emissions. Carbon Chain’s main users are gas and oil companies, 
        regulators, and carbon traders. Carbon Chain’s product tracks carbon emissions down to each piece 
        of equipment used in a supply chain. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We decided to design their main product’s interface for a 
        user to view emissions and supply chains. We imagined that our users would each have custom needs 
        in terms of what data was most important to them. Companies or regulators are dealing with vast 
        amounts of data and ever changing regulations, so we wanted our interface to be customizable, 
        simple, and insightful.</p>
