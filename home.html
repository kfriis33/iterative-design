    <h1>Carbon Chain</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>Carbon Chain Context</h2>
      <p>Our startup was Carbon Chain, which provides software for companies to more accurately and 
        efficiently track their carbon emissions. Carbon Chain’s main users are gas and oil companies, 
        regulators, and carbon traders. Carbon Chain’s product tracks carbon emissions down to each piece 
        of equipment used in a supply chain. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We decided to design their main product’s interface for a 
        user to view emissions and supply chains. We imagined that our users would each have custom needs 
        in terms of what data was most important to them. Companies or regulators are dealing with vast 
        amounts of data and ever changing regulations, so we wanted our interface to be customizable, 
        simple, and insightful.

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>Next, we gathered more feedback on our interface through user testing. We submitted our prototype, 
        a task, and follow-up questions and got responses from 3 users.</p>
      <h3>Taks and Questions for Users</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Main Task:  Imagine you work at an oil company and are a new user of this product. Edit one of your existing supply chains.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Users were also given context on the startup and informed that this was a prototype not a website.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Subtasks</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Log in </li>
          <li>Describe what you can do on this website (do not leave the dashboard)</li>
          <li>Where would you go to edit a supply chain? Explain what you would expect to see there</li>
          <li>Modify a specific step in the supply chain</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Post-test Questions</li>
        <ul>
          <li>How easy or hard was it to complete the task? (0=Really easy, 6=Really hard) Why?</li>
          <li>If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this site?</li>
          <li>What did you like about the site?</li>
          <li>Would you add anything to the site? Were there any features you wished to see?</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>>
